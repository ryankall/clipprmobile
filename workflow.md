   - Message appears in barber's messages page
   - Unread count increases
   - Barber can view details and choose to book or decline

### Current Status: âœ… Implemented
- Public booking pages working

## Workflow 2: Barber Books Appointment from Message

**Trigger**: Barber clicks "Book Appointment" button on a booking request message

### Steps:
1. **Client lookup/creation**
   - System checks if client exists by phone number
   - If client doesn't exist: creates new client record
   - If client exists: updates address and email if provided

2. **Schedule appointment modal**
   - Pre-fills appointment form with message data
   - Client name, phone, email auto-populated
   - Services, date, time pre-selected
   - Address and notes pre-filled

3. **Appointment creation** (Modified workflow needed)
   - Creates appointment with "pending" status
   - Creates 30-minute reservation
   - Sends SMS confirmation request to client
   - Appointment appears in "Pending Reservations" card only

### Current Status: âœ… Partially implemented (needs SMS confirmation)
- Client lookup/creation working
- Modal pre-filling working
- Need to modify to create pending appointments with SMS confirmation

---

## Workflow 3: Direct Barber Appointment Creation

**Trigger**: Barber goes to calendar and manually creates appointment

### Steps:
1. **Manual appointment creation**
   - Barber navigates to calendar page
   - Clicks "Book Appointment" button

2. **Appointment creation** (Modified workflow needed)
   - Creates appointment with "pending" status
   - Creates 30-minute reservation  
   - Sends SMS confirmation request to client
   - Appointment appears in "Pending Reservations" card only

### Current Status: âœ… Partially implemented (needs SMS confirmation)
- Manual creation form working
- Need to modify to create pending appointments with SMS confirmation

---

## Workflow 4: SMS Confirmation System (To Be Implemented)

**Trigger**: Appointment created (from message booking or manual creation)

### Steps:
1. **SMS sent to client**
   - Message: "Hi [Name]! Your appointment for [Service] on [Date] at [Time] is pending. Reply YES to confirm or NO to cancel."
   - 30-minute expiration timer starts
   - Appointment status: "pending"

2. **Client confirms (YES)**
   - Appointment status changes to "confirmed"
   - Moves from "Pending Reservations" to "Current/Next" cards
   - Bell notification for barber
   - Message sent to barber: "[Client] confirmed their appointment"

3. **Client cancels (NO)**
   - Appointment deleted from system
   - Bell notification for barber
   - Message sent to barber: "[Client] cancelled their appointment"

4. **Timeout (30 minutes no response)**
   - Appointment automatically deleted
   - Bell notification for barber
   - Message sent to barber: "[Client] appointment expired (no response)"

### Current Status: ðŸ”„ To be implemented

## Workflow 5: Client SMS Cancellation (To Be Implemented)

**Trigger**: Client sends "CANCEL" via SMS (for any confirmed appointment)

### Steps:
1. **SMS processing**
   - System receives "CANCEL" SMS from client
   - Looks up client's active appointments by phone number

2. **Appointment cancellation**
   - Deletes appointment from calendar
   - Bell notification for barber
   - Message sent to barber: "[Client] cancelled their [Service] appointment on [Date]"

3. **Confirmation to client**
   - SMS reply: "Your appointment has been cancelled. Thanks!"

### Current Status: ðŸ”„ To be implemented

## Workflow 6: Appointment Status Management (âœ… Implemented)

**Current Implementation**: Comprehensive status-based appointment system

### Appointment Statuses:
- **pending**: Appointment created but not yet confirmed
- **confirmed**: Appointment confirmed and ready to show in dashboard
- **cancelled**: Appointment cancelled, no longer affects scheduling
- **no show**: Client didn't show up for appointment

### Dashboard Behavior:
1. **Current/Next appointment cards**: Only show appointments with "confirmed" status
2. **Pending confirmations card**: Shows only appointments with "pending" status  
3. **Cancelled appointments**: Do not appear in any dashboard cards

### Calendar Behavior:
1. **All appointments visible**: Shows pending, confirmed, cancelled, and no show appointments
2. **Visual distinction**: Different styling for different statuses
3. **Deletion allowed**: Cancelled appointments can be safely deleted

### Overlap Detection:
1. **Ignores cancelled appointments**: Cancelled appointments don't block new bookings
2. **Considers pending and confirmed**: Both pending and confirmed appointments prevent overlaps
3. **Detailed conflict reporting**: Shows specific conflicting appointments with times

### Testing Results:
- âœ… Only confirmed appointments appear in current/next cards
- âœ… Cancelled pending appointments disappear from pending confirmations card
- âœ… Cancelled appointments don't affect scheduling overlap detection
- âœ… Calendar shows all appointment statuses for complete visibility
- âœ… Appointment deletion works correctly with foreign key constraints
