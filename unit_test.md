## Test Categories

### 1. New Critical Business Logic Tests (Latest)

#### Pending Slot Locking Tests
**File**: `client/src/test/pendingSlotLocking.test.ts`
**Purpose**: Validates the critical bug fix for pending appointment slot blocking

**Tests Covered**:
- ✅ Pending appointments properly block availability slots
- ✅ Confirmed appointments continue to block slots
- ✅ Cancelled appointments do NOT block slots  
- ✅ Expired appointments do NOT block slots
- ✅ Duration-based blocking works correctly (60-minute appointment blocks 4 slots)
- ✅ Multiple appointments with mixed statuses handled properly
- ✅ Specific bug case validation (jake boo boo at 9:00am pending)

**Business Impact**: Ensures the public booking system prevents double bookings by correctly excluding time slots for both pending and confirmed appointments.

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data Structure
The test suite uses comprehensive mock data that mirrors production data structures:

```typescript
// User Mock Data
const mockUser = {
  id: 1,
  email: 'test@example.com',
  firstName: 'Test',
  lastName: 'User',
  phone: '(555) 123-4567',
  homeBaseAddress: '123 Main St',
  workingHours: { /* comprehensive schedule */ },
  timezone: 'America/New_York'
}

// Client Mock Data
const mockClients = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'John Doe',
    phone: '(555) 987-6543',
    loyaltyStatus: 'gold',
    totalVisits: 15
  }
]

// Service Mock Data
const mockServices = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Haircut',
    price: '35.00',
    duration: 45,
    category: 'Haircuts'
  }
]
```

### API Mocking Strategy
Using MSW (Mock Service Worker) for realistic API behavior:

```typescript
export const handlers = [
  http.get('/api/auth/me', () => HttpResponse.json(mockUser)),
  http.post('/api/appointments', async ({ request }) => {
    const newAppointment = await request.json();
    // Validation and response logic
    return HttpResponse.json(createdAppointment);
  }),
  // Comprehensive endpoint coverage
]
```

## Test Execution

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

npm run test AppointmentCard.test.tsx

# Run tests matching pattern
npm run test appointment
```

### Test Scripts Configuration
**File**: `package.json`
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui"
  }
}
```

## Continuous Integration

### Test Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:coverage
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run type-check
```

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage must not decrease below thresholds
- No TypeScript errors allowed
- ESLint warnings addressed

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
1. **Describe blocks**: Group related tests logically
2. **Clear test names**: Describe expected behavior
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure test logic clearly
4. **Mock isolation**: Each test should be independent

### Mock Management
1. **Realistic data**: Mock data should match production schemas
2. **Edge cases**: Include boundary conditions and error states
3. **API consistency**: Mock responses match actual API behavior
4. **State management**: Reset mocks between tests

### Performance Optimization
1. **Parallel execution**: Tests run concurrently where possible
2. **Selective imports**: Import only needed test utilities
3. **Efficient mocking**: Minimize heavy mock setups
4. **Smart watching**: Only re-run affected tests during development

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update test data when schema changes
- Refresh API mocks when endpoints evolve
- Review coverage reports monthly
- Update testing dependencies quarterly

### Documentation
- Document new test patterns
- Update coverage requirements as app grows
- Maintain mock data documentation
- Record testing decisions and rationale

## Integration Testing
