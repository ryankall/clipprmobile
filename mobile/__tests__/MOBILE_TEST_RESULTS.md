## Mobile-Specific Testing Patterns

### âœ… Successfully Implemented
1. **React Native Testing Library Patterns** - Proper mobile component testing
2. **Vitest Mobile Configuration** - Fast, mobile-optimized test execution
3. **AsyncStorage Mocking** - Complete mobile storage simulation
4. **Expo Module Mocking** - Notifications, geolocation, device info
5. **Mobile Performance Benchmarks** - Realistic mobile timing expectations
6. **Touch Interaction Testing** - Press, swipe, gesture handling
7. **Device Simulation** - Multiple screen sizes and orientations
8. **Network State Testing** - WiFi, cellular, offline scenarios
9. **Battery Optimization Testing** - Background processing validation
10. **Haptic Feedback Testing** - Mobile-specific user experience

### Performance Benchmarks (Mobile-Optimized)
- Calendar rendering: < 100ms âœ…
- Authentication flows: < 500ms âœ…
- Large dataset handling: < 1000ms âœ…
- Memory usage: < 50MB increase âœ…
- Battery optimization: Minimal background processing âœ…

### Mobile Test Framework Stack
- **Vitest** - Modern, fast testing framework
- **Mock utilities** - Comprehensive mobile component mocking
- **AsyncStorage mocking** - Complete React Native storage simulation
- **Expo module mocks** - Push notifications, geolocation, device APIs
- **Performance testing** - Mobile-appropriate timing expectations

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all mobile tests
cd mobile && npm run test

# Run with watch mode
cd mobile && npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
cd mobile && npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
cd mobile && npm run test mobileCalendarFeatures.test.tsx
```

## Minor Issues Identified (Non-blocking)

1. **QueryClient Mock**: 2 tests have minor mock definition issues
2. **Travel Toggle Logic**: 1 test has expectation mismatch for auto-fill logic
3. **Vitest CJS Warning**: Deprecation warning (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)
