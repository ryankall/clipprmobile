Implement a Premium plan cancellation and refund system that:

Allows users to cancel anytime

Offers a 30-day money-back guarantee

Integrates with Stripe for subscriptions and refunds

Includes unit tests to verify logic and UI behavior

✅ Functional Requirements
1. Cancel Anytime
Users can cancel their monthly or annual Premium subscription any time via the Settings → Billing section

When cancelled:

Access continues through the end of current billing period

No refund issued unless within 30-day window

Use Stripe’s Cancel Subscription API

UI Text:
“Cancel anytime. Your premium access will remain active until [end_date].”

2. 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee
If user cancels within 30 days of their first Premium payment, allow them to request a full refund

Use Stripe’s Create Refund API

After refund:

Downgrade account to Basic

Revoke Premium features immediately

Track the subscription_start_date or first_payment_timestamp in DB to calculate refund eligibility

UI Text (Settings):
“Not satisfied? You’re eligible for a full refund until [refund_deadline].”

🔐 Backend Logic
Refund Eligibility Check
function isEligibleForRefund(subscriptionStartDate: Date): boolean {
  const now = new Date();
  const diffInMs = now.getTime() - subscriptionStartDate.getTime();
  const diffInDays = diffInMs / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  return diffInDays <= 30;
}
📱 UI Changes (Settings Page)
Add “Cancel Subscription” button

If within refund window, show “Request Full Refund” CTA

Show current subscription tier and expiration

All upgrade prompts throughout app should link here

🧪 Unit Test Requirements
1. Refund Eligibility Logic

describe("isEligibleForRefund", () => {
  it("returns true within 30 days", () => {
    const date = new Date(Date.now() - 15 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    expect(isEligibleForRefund(date)).toBe(true);
  });

  it("returns false after 30 days", () => {
    const date = new Date(Date.now() - 35 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    expect(isEligibleForRefund(date)).toBe(false);
  });
});
2. UI Behavior Tests
✅ “Cancel Subscription” button appears for Premium users

✅ “Request Refund” only shows if within 30 days

✅ Clicking refund:

Calls refund API

Downgrades plan

Disables Premium features

✅ Upgrade prompts route to Settings → Billing card

💳 Stripe Integration Tips

Use stripe.refunds.create({ payment_intent: paymentIntentId })

Track Eligibility:

Store subscription start timestamp in your DB (user.subscriptionStartDate)
