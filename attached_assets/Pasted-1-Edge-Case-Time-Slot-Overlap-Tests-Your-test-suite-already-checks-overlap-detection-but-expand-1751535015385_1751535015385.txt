1. Edge Case Time Slot & Overlap Tests
Your test suite already checks overlap detection, but expand to include:

Scenario	Add tests for‚Ä¶
Buffer times	Service ends at 2:00, next starts at 2:30 ‚Äî verify valid
Back-to-back	Bookings at 1:00 and 1:45 with 45-min duration ‚Äî should conflict
Travel time insertion	If travel buffer is 5 mins + the distance to travel to distance with google calculations, the appointment time block slot should be the duration of service + buffer+ travel distance calculated by google. 
DST transition	Booking during daylight savings time shift ‚Äî does system show correct time?

2. SMS Edge Case Flow Tests
Test unexpected client responses or timing:

Case	Example
Lowercase or misspelled replies	yes, cancel, ye, yess ‚Äî test fuzzy matching
SMS delay edge	Client replies 1 second after 30-min cutoff ‚Äî verify it's ignored
Duplicate replies	Client replies YES twice ‚Äî ensure no duplication or error
No reply at all	Simulate no response after 30 min ‚Üí check cleanup logic triggered

‚úÖ Consider mocking Twilio webhook responses in travelTimeService.test.ts or a new smsConfirmation.test.ts.

3. Admin/Backoffice Logic (if exists)
If you have any of the following, test them:

Rebooking or rescheduling logic

Manual override for client confirmations

Data exports or analytics calculations (i.e., ‚Äúhow many no-shows?‚Äù)

Batch actions (delete all expired, cancel all pending)

4. Payment Edge Cases
You mention Stripe testing ‚Äî make sure to test:

Case	Add tests for‚Ä¶
Incomplete payments	Client closes Stripe modal mid-payment
Currency edge case	Non-USD payments if you plan to support international
Refund logic (manual or auto)	If canceling an appointment post-payment
Partial payments (deposit)	Deposit + remaining logic, if implemented later

5. Mobile-Specific Quirks (React Native)
Even though unit tests don‚Äôt cover device behavior directly, it‚Äôs worth testing:

Touch interactions on forms

Date pickers (especially around locale/timezone)

Offline mode: Does form validation and local state persist without connection?

‚úÖ Some of these are best handled in your Cypress or E2E suite, but component logic should handle those states properly.

6. Race Condition & Parallel Request Handling
Especially for booking workflows:

Test	Why
Two clients try to book the same time simultaneously	One should win, one gets ‚Äútime taken‚Äù
Client confirms same time twice	Ensure only one confirmation is accepted
Barber modifies or cancels appointment during pending confirmation	SMS reply should be ignored if appointment is gone

This is best done by mocking two requests firing at the same time.
