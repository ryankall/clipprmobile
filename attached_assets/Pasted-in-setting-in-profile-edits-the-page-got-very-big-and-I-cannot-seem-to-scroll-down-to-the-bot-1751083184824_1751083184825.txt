in setting:
in profile edits:
 - the page got very big and I cannot seem to scroll down to the bottom to click the buttons
 - for the home base address can you verify the address the added is valid.
 - when I enter a business name it changes the background of the box to white. Change this  and all input text box to in profile edits to match "service area" box
 - make sure phone number is valid and formatted
 - make sure email is valid

Smart Quick Actions for Communication
✔️ Auto-detect next appointment
✔️ Show quick message buttons (like “Running late”)
✔️ Send to that appointment’s client via SMS/email

This is 90% of the way there — now let’s make it more foolproof and user-friendly.

🧠 Refined Strategy
🔍 1. Auto-select the next appointment intelligently
Check current time vs all today’s appointments

Pick the next one that:

Starts within 1 hour from now, or

Is marked as “not started” and “confirmed”
    - when booking an appointment send a sms for the client to confirmed if sms is available otherwise use email to confirm 
    - We need a reply from sms/emal to have confirmation of an a booking sent to a clients and then it update our calendar

If none match, disable the quick action (or prompt the user to manually select a client)

✅ This avoids messaging the wrong person or spamming future clients too early

💬 2. Use templated but customizable messages
Show 2–3 default templates, like:

“Hey [ClientName], I’m running a little late — I’ll be there in ~15 mins. Thanks for your patience!”

“Just a heads up! I’m finishing up the last client and on my way.”

“Hi [ClientName], I’m delayed a bit — ETA is [AutoCalcETA or CustomTime]. Appreciate your patience!”

Let the barber either:

Tap to send immediately

Or edit the message before sending

📲 3. Use SMS by default, email as fallback
Most clients will respond faster to SMS

Only use email if:

No phone number is stored

SMS quota is exceeded or fails

⏱️ 4. Add contextual triggers
Optionally show the “Running late” button only if:

ETA (from Google Maps) > appointment start time

OR the current time is within 20 minutes of the appointment

This keeps the UI clean and prevents premature messages.

🔐 Bonus: Log the Communication
Store each SMS sent with:

Timestamp

Client name

Message body

Response status (if Twilio reports delivery or reply)

This helps in case of disputes or for professional audit trails.
